    "For my capstone , I applied the skills I derived from two mains course in the MSBA program: Python for Business Analytics and Business Intelligence . These two courses contributed the most to the analytical skills demonstrated in my project. The main object of this project is to build awareness of the prevalet issue of domestic violence. The Jesuit values I learned at Fairfield University allowed me to frame real life issues within my coursework. This project explores the health field and the responsibility of nurses who come face to face with victims of domestic violence on a daily basis. \n",

    "### Problem \n",
    "Victims who suffer non fatal injury from intimate partner violence that seek medical attention are not being properly identified or referred to the right resources. By utilizing data collected nationwide on intimate partner violence we can enhance the routine assessment for nurses so victims of domestic violence can be identified and referred/recommended to the right treatment program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "There is an opportunity to utilize historical data in effort to reduce the chances of  victims being exposed to the same perpetrator and ultimately reduce  domestic violence in general.A classification system (victims in need of treatment decision tree)can aid nurses. This will allow nurses to identif more potential victims of domestic violence and connect them with the right resources for follow ups.The decision tree is a screening algorithm for female patients admitted for non-fatal injury. The decision tree first identifies whether or not a patient is a  possible victim, not victim or unknown. Based on which class the patient is identified as : Yes, No or Unknown the tree allows the nurse to identify what type of abuse the Yes Class is. Each abuse type is treated with necessary caution. In the end the decision tree provides patients the necessary referral method and information needed. \n",

    "## Background/Motivation\n",
    "As a survivor of **intimate partner violence , commonly referred to as domestic violence** every year I make it my mission to voice my experience  to others in hopes that by educating the public we become one step closer to addressing the issue of domestic violence (DV). Many victims of DV do not report it therefore the data collected on DV does not accurately represent the population as a whole. For DV victims who do report their experience, they have a better chance of receiving proper treatment. The first time I was a victim I never reported it however the second time I was a victim , the policy brought me to the Emergency room. Although I couldn't physically talk at the time due to my injury, the Nurse asked me a limited amount of questions to assess my ‘situation’. After being released from the hospital I did not receive any follow up call from the hospital, or any information for DV outreach programs. I seeked counseling on my own. Years later when I visited the doctor for a routine check up  I was asked questions such as : whether or not I’ve ever been harmed, abused, etc.  At that moment I wished someone did call me after I identified myself but I never received any form of follow up. Today nurses are considered “ natural leaders among health care professionals to address domestic violence” (futurewithoutviolence.org). By partnering with nurses there’s a better chance of reducing repeat victims , potential victims and the effect of being abused  by treating affected victims early on.\n",
    "Adolescents are most at risk for encountering domestic and/or relationship violence, “Nearly 1.5 million high school students nationwide experience physical abuse from a dating partner in a single year” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to treat all female patients admitted with non-fatal injury as potential victims.  Victims are identified through machine learning. The datasets used investigate historical features on actual victims. The dataset historical values predict whether or not a patient is a potential victim .The decision tree serves as a screening algorithm  aids in assigning the more proper follow up method with each female patient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives: \n",
    "- Currently nurses perform routine assessment but there’s no follow up for patients after assessment. Each patient needs a follow up depedning on what kind of victim they identified as dictates the 'referral/recommendation'.\n",
    "- Victims are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, use harmful substances (like tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs), engage in unhealthy dieting behaviors, and experience depression and anxiety. By identify victims as early as possible one can reduce the exposure to these risks or reduce the severity.\n",
